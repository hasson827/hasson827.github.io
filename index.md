# Hello, I'm Zhao Hongshuo! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a second-year student at **Zhejiang University-University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign Institute (ZJUI)** (2024-2028), passionate about the intersection of artificial intelligence, generative models, and End-to-End Phonon Band Structure Prediction. I am the principal of a national innovation project named *Research on AI-driven Phonon Band Prediction for High-throughput Screening of Thermal Properties of Materials* directed by Professor Ong-WeeLiat. Additionally, in the summer holiday, I participated in the research about *Gaussian-Mixture Variational Flow Matching for Inverse Problem* directed by Professor Meng Xiangming.

## ðŸŒŸ About Me
- **Academic Interests**: Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Neural Networks, Artificial Intelligence, Crystal Property Prediction
- **Academic Performance**: Professional GPA: 4.00/4.00 | Cumulative GPA: 3.951/4.00
- **Hobbies**: Coding, Playing volleyball (I'm the captain of the school volleyball team as outside hitter)

## ðŸ“š My Projects


## ðŸš€ Future Plans
- Dive deeper into generative model applications (e.g., image generation or physical simulations)
- Share more AI and science-related projects with the open-source community
- Develop and expand the learning and note community of the school to benefit all students in the grade.
